Quarto is a board game for two players invented by Swiss mathematician Blaise MÃ¼ller in 1991.

Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board.
A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of four pieces, all of which have a common attribute (all short, all circular, etc.).

This is a node.js / webgl multiplayers experimentation of this game.
